# WebSocket Notifications

This project demonstrates how to build a real-time notification system using WebSocket with Spring Boot. It enables real-time communication between the server and clients, allowing notifications to be pushed from the backend to the frontend instantly.

## Features

- **Real-Time Notifications:** Push notifications from the backend to connected WebSocket clients.
- **Spring Boot Integration:** Leverage Spring Boot's support for WebSocket to manage connections.
- **Frontend JavaScript Integration:** Easily connect the frontend to the WebSocket server to display notifications.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NyiKyaw/websocket-notifications.git
2. Build and run the Spring Boot application.
3. Open the frontend in your browser, and you will start receiving real-time notifications.

## Technologies Used

- **Spring Boot** for backend development.
- **WebSocket** for real-time communication.
- **JavaScript** for frontend integration.

## Testing the Application

1. **Start the Spring Boot application** by running the main class in your IDE or by using the command:
   ```bash
   ./mvnw spring-boot:run

2. **Access the frontend** through `http://localhost:8080` or the appropriate URL based on your configuration.
